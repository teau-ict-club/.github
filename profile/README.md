<h1 align="center">Welcome To The The East African University's ICT Club </h1>

# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This club was formed in the 2021 academic year by students and lectures to provide a link between academics and industry standards of software engineering. Learning programming as a solo affair didn't seem fun hence this community was formed. ```The core concept being to learn by doing```.

It goes without saying that if you encountered this organization, it wasn't by mistake so explore as much as you can!


We have a number of teams working on a wide array or projects. Each of these teams has a purpose to solve current world problems with code which gives its participants real world experience. The students have creative freedom hence whichever amazing idea is pitched it's realized.
- The teams are;
    - [Web Development](https://github.com/orgs/teau-ict-club/teams/web-dev-team)
    - [Mobile Development](https://github.com/orgs/teau-ict-club/teams/mobile-app-dev-team)
    - [Cyber Security](https://github.com/orgs/teau-ict-club/teams/cybersec-team)
    - [Machine Learning & Data Science](https://github.com/orgs/teau-ict-club/teams/machine_learning-and-data_science)
    - [Graphics Design & UI/UX design](https://github.com/orgs/teau-ict-club/teams/graphics-and-ui_ux)


If you're new to programming or software development in general, check out these [resources](https://github.com/teau-ict-club/.github/blob/main/Resources.md). They are made by people who once were where you are now.
